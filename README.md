I worked on my personal project during my studies at Vilnius Coding School.
Utilizing data from a short-term rental reservation system, I organized information and developed new tools. Using the Python programming language,
I scraped data from booking.com, sorted it according to relevant criteria, and created an AI that suggests the TOP 10 best results.
I analyzed price trends for each month of the year and developed a price prediction model using machine learning. 
For this, I employed linear regression, Lasso regression, Random Forest regression, and neural networks. Finally, I compared the obtained results and visualized them in graphs.
